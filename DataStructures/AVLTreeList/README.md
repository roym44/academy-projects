# Introduction
The first project of the Data Structures (fall 2023) course.

We implement the ADT List using an AVL tree. 
Each member in the list has a value (info).

To make things a bit easier, we assume each leaf has two "virtual" sons, i.e. nodes which do not represent actual members in the data structure.

## Documentation
Full documentation can be found in the pdf file, which contains also answers to theoratical exercises given in this project.
An explanation about the general idea can be found in the pptx file.
