# Introduction
The second project of the Data Structures (fall 2023) course.

We implement a Fibonacci Heap.

The members in the heap are always integers, with no duplicates.

To make things a bit easier, we add several more constraints:

1. The trees in the heap go left (new) to right (old).
2. Roots are never marked.
